# ATMSwitch
 A complete SystemVerilog testbench for an ATM Switch Design

 The testbench creates constrained randome stimulus, and gathers functional coverage. It is structed according to the guidellines from SystemVerilog for Verification, Sutherland. So you can inject new behaviors without modifying the lower-level blocks.

 The ATM Switch can be configured from 4x4 and 16x16.
